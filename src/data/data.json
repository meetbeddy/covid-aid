        "post": "To help lessen the spread of the new coronavirus and COVID-19, the disease it causes, here are important steps that can help protect you, your family and others.\r\n\r\n<h4>Avoid close contact with others</h4>\r\n\r\nIt’s important to understand that the new coronavirus spreads mainly from person to person. If an infected person coughs or sneezes, their droplets can infect people nearby. That’s why it’s important to avoid close contact with others. Understand that people (including children) may be infected with the new coronavirus and have only mild symptoms.\r\n\r\nSome measures you can take to avoid close contact with others include:\r\n\r\n<li>Stay home as much as possible and reduce visitors.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Practice physical distancing:</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Stay at least six feet away from others in public places</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Call friends and family or visit by video.<li>\r\n\r\n<li>Ask your employer if it’s possible to work from home.</li>\r\n\r\nAvoid people who appear sick.\r\n\r\nWear a face mask whenever you are in a public place where you will encounter other people. The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 can spread between people interacting in close proximity — for example, speaking, coughing, sneezing, or singing— even if those people do not symptoms. Learn more information about how masks help prevent the spread of COVID-19.\r\n\r\n<h4>Practice good hygiene wherever you are.</h4>\r\n\r\nThe new coronavirus can survive for hours or even days on some surfaces. Touching a contaminated surface and then touching your face is one of the ways to become infected.\r\n\r\nThe virus is no longer detectable on plastic after 72 hours, and on stainless steel or cardboard after about 48 hours. With that in mind:\r\n\r\n<li>Wash your hands with soap and water frequently and thoroughly for at least 20 seconds, especially After being in public places and touching door handles, shopping carts, elevator buttons, etc.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>If soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.</li>\r\n\r\nAvoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth, especially with unwashed hands.\r\n\r\nIf you cough or sneeze, do so in the bend of your elbow. If you use a tissue, throw it away immediately.\r\n\r\n<h4>Take precautions if you are living with or caring for someone who is sick.</h4>\r\n\r\n<li>Wear a mask if you are caring for someone who has respiratory symptoms.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Clean counters, door knobs, phones and tablets frequently, using disinfectant cleaners or wipes.<li>\r\n\r\n<h4>If you feel sick, follow these guidelines:</h4>\r\n\r\n<li>Stay home if you feel sick unless you are experiencing a medical emergency such as severe shortness of breath or a very high fever.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Call your doctor or urgent care facility and explain your symptoms over the phone.</li> "

        "post": "As the new coronavirus continues to spread, so do anxieties about COVID-19, the illness it causes.\r\n\r\nHere are some tips to manage corana virus related stress\r\n\r\n<h4>Prepare, don’t panic.</h4>\r\n\r\nFrom the news to social media, a lot of information is circulating about the new coronavirus. Some is true, but much of it may be misinformed or only partly correct, especially as information rapidly changes.\r\n\r\n<h4>Talk To Your Children</h4>\r\n\r\nChildren may feel afraid or anxious about the new coronavirus. It’s important to validate feelings of worry and not dismiss them outright, advises McGuire. He offers the following tips:\r\n\r\n<li>Listen. After hearing their children out, parents can fill them in with correct information to calm their worries.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Provide accurate information. Determine what your children already know about the virus and give them accurate information to reduce their risk of catching it. “This might include asking children about specific concerns or what they know about the coronavirus, and providing practical solutions to help them minimize any risk,”</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Focus on prevention. Keep discussions focused on preventive actions. Set up and praise healthy hand-washing habits, and maintain regular routines for playtime, meals and other activities.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>If someone in your family is sick with COVID-19 or another illness, it can be hard for children to understand. “This is where it is important to have an established plan to minimize the worries and keep focused on proactive solutions,” says McGuire. “You know your child and how they learn best — make sure that your explanations are clear and helpful.”</li>\r\n\r\n<h4>Be mindful.</h4>\r\n\r\nOne way to lessen worry is to ground yourself in the present moment through mindfulness. “Mindfulness is a great technique that can help reduce stress during challenging times”. You can practice mindfulness by sitting quietly and focusing on your breathing and senses.\r\n\r\nAnother way to manage stress is by limiting computer screen time and media exposure. “While keeping informed about current events is important, too much attention can cause problems,” explains McGuire. “Setting boundaries can prevent feeling overwhelmed by the situation.\r\n\r\n“It is important to not let fear control your life.”"

        "title": "Coronavirus, Social and Physical Distancing and Self-Quarantine",
        "post": "Now that the new coronavirus and COVID-19, the illness it causes, are spreading among communities in the United States and other countries, phrases such as “physical distancing,” “self-quarantine” and “flattening the curve” are showing up in the media.What do they mean, and how might they apply to you, your family and your community?\r\n\r\n<h4>What is social distancing?</h4>\r\n\r\nThe practice of social distancing means staying home and away from others as much as possible to help prevent spread of COVID-19. The practice of social distancing encourages the use of things such as online video and phone communication instead of in-person contact.\r\n\r\nAs communities reopen and people are more often in public, the term “physical distancing” (instead of social distancing) is being used to reinforce the need to stay at least 6 feet from others, as well as wearing face masks.  Historically, social distancing was also used interchangeably to indicate physical distancing which is defined below.  However, social distancing is a strategy distinct from the physical distancing behavior.\r\n\r\n<h4>What is physical distancing?</h4>\r\n\r\nPhysical distancing is the practice of staying at least 6 feet away from others to avoid catching a disease such as COVID-19.\r\n\r\nAs noted above, “social distancing” is a term that was used earlier in the pandemic as many people stayed home to help prevent spread of the virus. Now as communities are reopening and people are in public more often, physical distancing is used to stress the importance of maintaining physical space when in public areas.\r\n\r\n<h4>How can I practice physical distancing?</h4>\r\n\r\nWear a face mask or covering when you are not in your home and whenever you are around people who are not members of your household. Maintain at least 6 feet of distance between yourself and others. Avoid crowded places, particularly indoors, and events that are likely to draw crowds.\r\n\r\nOther examples of social and physical distancing to avoid larger crowds or crowded spaces are:\r\n\r\n<li>Workng from home instead of the office</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Closing schools or online classes</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Visiting loved ones by electronic devices instead of in person</li>\r\n\r\n<h4>What is self-quarantine?</h4>\r\n\r\nPeople who have been exposed to the new coronavirus and who are at risk for coming down with COVID-19 might practice self-quarantine. Health experts recommend that self-quarantine lasts 14 days. Two weeks provides enough time for them to know whether or not they will become ill and be contagious to other people.\r\n\r\nYou might be asked to practice self-quarantine if you have recently returned from traveling to a part of the country or the world where COVID-19 is spreading rapidly, or if you have knowingly been exposed to an infected person.\r\n\r\nSelf-quarantine involves:\r\n\r\n<li>Using standard hygiene and washing hands frequently</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Not sharing things like towels and utensils</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Not having visitors</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Staying at least 6 feet away from other people in your household</li>\r\n\r\nOnce your quarantine period has ended, if you do not have symptoms, follow your doctor’s instructions on how to return to your normal routine.\r\n\r\n<h4>What is isolation?</h4>\r\n\r\nFor people who are confirmed to have COVID-19, isolation is appropriate. Isolation is a health care term that means keeping people who are infected with a contagious illness away from those who are not infected. Isolation can take place at home or at a hospital or care facility. Special personal protective equipment will be used to care for these patients in health care settings.\r\n\r\n"
